            <h2>Hey! First Post.</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/6/20</h4><br>
            <p>So, I guess you could say that this is my first post...today I really wasnt feeling coding. Because
                we all should take a break from time to time. But there is so much to do at this point. I ended up
                finishing the template to my portfolio. I was working with media queries and figuring all that out.
                Getting the sizing right for all the types of displays can be a pain. But hey..gotta learn somehow.
                :) </p>

            <h2>Adding to the build.....</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/7/20</h4><br>
            <p>Slowly getting around to adding all my projects to this portfolio site of mine. As for actual coding,
                I did tidy up my car forum site a bit with the html but nothing major. I was also messing around
                with my spotify and pandora situation. You have to have good music to code right? :) In the morning
                I plan on messing with more javascript and maybe a little phase js.</p>

            <h2>Tested myself on TripleByte.</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/8/20</h4><br>
            <p>So it was suggested to me to take this test given to me by my career advisor. I think I did okay, but
                room for improvement. But also not bad for someone in the industry for only a few months. Also the
                website that hosts it is a pretty good tool as well when it comes to the job hunt. I may revisit
                this again when I get more notches in my belt.</p>

            <h4 class="date">9/9/20</h4><br>
            <p>Started the day with building and running my FIRST! Angular projects. Much more involved than a
                normal Django project. But with more reps, I can get it down for sure. It did not help that the walk
                through I was following was incomplete..but thru the power of google we made it.</p>

            <p>Also I was dabbling with the HTML canvas and made a dog head from some javascript. :) </p>

            <h2>Joining the React Bus...</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/11/20</h4><br>
            <p>I was doing some research and was looking into another language, or framework to learn. I found out
                that for obvious reasons React was the way to go, the other option being Angular. I was told that
                Angular changes a lot. So that made my decision easy, but with learning React I will have to pick up
                C and a few others.</p>

            <h2>Projects page...</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/12/20</h4><br>
            <p>Today, I spent the morning studying on JSX a bit, then I wanted to fine tune my projects page a bit. CSS
                is a whole different ball game when it comes to styling and animations. I do find it enjoyable, for the
                creativity aspect of it. They even sprinkle in a javascript!</p>

            <h2>Javascript!</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/12/20</h4><br>
            <p>Bought a new book...well membership to Packt. It was told it was a good service if I am to learn a few
                more languages. I was looking into C, but really wanted to strengthen my JS a bit more. My boot camp I
                went to only spent 2 weeks on it, so we just skimmed the surface really. But I was productive and made a
                Movie Seat Selector application! You can check it out <a
                    href="https://ktlim83.github.io/MovieSeatsSelector/">Here!</a>" </p>

            <h2>More Javascript!!!</h2>
            <h4 class="date">9/15/20</h4><br>
            <p>Unsure of how important it is, but i am learning to create modals and simple nav bars without the use of bootstrap. ill compile all this stuff and improve my portfolio a bit. but learning by all this repitition is becoming helpful. </p>
